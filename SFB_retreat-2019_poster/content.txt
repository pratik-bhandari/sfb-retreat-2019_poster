Human brain is a prediction generating machine.  (Friston,
2005; Clark, 2013)
I
Language comprehension is considered to be largely
predictive in nature.  (Pickering and Gambi, 2018; Lupyan
and Clark, 2015; Jaeger and Kuperberg, 2016
I
Spoken language comprehension depends not only on
contextual prediction but also the processing of auditory
signal.
I
The interaction of prediction and auditory perception differs
between younger adults(YA) and older adults(OA) when the
auditory stimuli are ’noisy’ even when controlled for hearing
loss.  (cite)
I
Spoken language comprehension in a challenging
environment is difficult for older adults compared to younger
adults.  (Schneider, Daneman, Pichora-Fuller, 2002)
I
In a noisy environment, older adults are benefited to a
greater extent than the younger adults by the context
(Sheldon, Pichora-Fuller, Schneider, 2007; Schneider,
Pichora-Fuller, 2000; Wingfield, Tun, 2007).
